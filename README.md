# OneDrive Version History Cleaner
This PowerShell script will delete OneDrive version history for all files.

## System Requirements
Windows 11 (tested)

## How It Works
Query and delete all version history by PowerShell script automatically. It will delete all the history but keep the current version.

## How to Use It
1. Change the variable $SiteURL to your own site url.
2. Start a PowerShell.
3. Run the script.

The script will save progress in a progress.txt file. So don't worry about a complete new start over after a disruption. Actually it will go on from the disruption point.
